Pong:

Single Player with an AI that always has the paddle moving in the right direction


ECS Architecture:
Entities, Components, Systems

Entities are made up of components, and systems operate on entities or components.


EX:

Player (Entity) has a "Physics Rigid Body" component attached.

The "physics" system queries all entities with the "Physics Rigid Body" component attached, 
and does a physics update on them using physics algorithms


A plugin is a bundle of systems, entities, and components, that are added to the application?

What do I need?

- paddle
- ball
- wall physics
- paddle to ball Physics
- input to move the paddle
- AI to move the enemy paddle

collision detection: ball and paddles have the same collision detection with the walls
but not with each other the collision of the ball onto the paddle is the same as onto the walls. except that the paddle will have some velocity

Entities:
ball
paddle
player
score

components:
position
velocity
acceleration?
display/sprite component
mass
physics_reaction (can be moved by physics engine)
physics_cause (can move other objects but is immune to any physics effects on itself)

systems:
physics system that resolves collisions by updating velocities on anything with physics_ components
input system: operates on the player entity
draw system that draws everything with a display component
